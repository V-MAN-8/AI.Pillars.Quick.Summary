## **NLP sentence segmentation and tokens**

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** : is the field dedicated to making **computers** understand and work with **human language**. Computers excel at structured data (neatly grouped and labeled), but human language is **unstructured** and messy.

## deal with the messiness of human language NLP

1. **Sentence Segmentation:** Computers begin by processing **one sentence at a time**.
2. **Tokenization:** The sentence is broken down into small chunks of information called **tokens**, which are then individually classified.
3. **Classification/Structuring:** Once tokens are sorted based on their meaning, the computer can begin to understand the information.

## Key Components for Understanding Language

- **Entities:** An **entity** is a **noun** representing a person, place, or thing.
    - *Example:* In the joke, "**I**," "**elephant**," and "**pajamas**" are entities.
- **Relationships:**
    - A **relationship** is a strong connection between **two or more entities**.
    - Identifying relationships helps AI structure the information.
    - *Example:* Identifying that the pronoun "**He**" in a second sentence refers back to the entity "**Armen**" in the first sentence.
- **Concepts:**
    - A **concept** is something that is **implied** in a sentence but **not actually stated**.
    - Identifying concepts is trickier as it involves matching ideas rather than specific words.

    ## Emotion Detection and Sentiment Analysis
    
    While both **Emotion Detection** and **Sentiment Analysis** deal with feelings rather than facts, they are two distinct approaches that help an AI better understand human language.
    
    **Emotion Detection:** aims to identify **distinct human emotion types**. AI is trained to classify the emotion being expressed, such as **anger**, **happiness**, or **fear**, often based on user feedback or comments. Identifying the correct emotional token is crucial, as different emotions can significantly change the meaning of a sentence in contexts like social media posts or customer service chats.
    
    **Sentiment Analysis**: **Sentiment Analysis** does **not** identify a specific emotion; rather, it measures the **strength** or **polarity** of the feeling. It functions as a sliding scale with **positive** at one end, **negative** at the other, and **neutral** in the middle. The goal of sentiment analysis is to assess whether the data is broadly **positive, negative, or neutral**.

    ## The Challenge of Classification
    
    - **Vagueness and Double Meanings:** Words often have multiple meanings depending on the context. For instance, in the riddle "Why does your nose **run** and your feet **smell**?", the words "run" and "smell" take on different meanings ("runny nose" vs. "run a race"; "unpleasant odor" vs. "smell a flower").
    - **Context Dependency:** An AI must rely heavily on the **context** of a sentence, not just the individual words (tokens).
        - *Example:* In "I went to the **docks** to **ship** my box," the word "**docks**" is the contextual clue that suggests the method of shipping is by **boat**.
        - In contrast, in "I went to the **station** to **ship** my box," the word "**station**" suggests shipping by **rail** (train).

    ## AI's Solution: Frequency and Confidence
    
    To overcome these classification challenges, AI systems use **statistical learning** based on vast amounts of data:
    
    1. **Frequency Identification:** The AI **ingests thousands of examples** (instances) of language use. It identifies the **frequency** with which certain words (like places or actions) are linked with specific concepts (like travel methods).
    2. **Gradual Improvement:** By analyzing these patterns (e.g., how often "shipping from a dock" is linked to "boat travel"), the system gradually **improves its classification** accuracy and makes fewer mistakes.
    3. **Confidence Value:** Because perfect classification is impossible, well-designed AI systems provide not only a response but also a **confidence value** (a probability score) to indicate how certain they are of the classification, similar to how humans sometimes have to guess the intended meaning.
    
    This process helps the AI bridge the gap from simple tokens and classifications to deeper understanding and responding to questions.

    ## Language & AI Classification Challenges
    
    - **Vague Terms:** Many words have multiple meanings, making it hard for an AI to determine the intended meaning based solely on the word itself.
    - **Example (Riddle):** In "Why does your nose **run** and your feet **smell**?", the words "run" and "smell" each have two different meanings related to a cold/liquid flow and an odor/sense perception, respectively.
    - **Examples (Contradictions):** Other examples include **shipping** (by train or boat), **burning down** a building (which burns up), and **filling in** a form (by filling it out).
    - **Context Dependence:** Classification is harder than mere token identification because the correct meaning often relies heavily on the **context** of the surrounding sentence or conversation.

    ### How AI Systems Tackle Classification
    
    - **Association and Frequency:** AI systems learn to classify by **ingesting massive amounts of data**.
    - **Learning Context:** They identify the **frequency** with which certain words (like places and types of travel) are linked.
    - **Example:** An AI associates "**shipping** from a **dock**" with **boat travel** and "**shipping** from a **station**" with **rail travel** by observing thousands of instances.
    - **Imperfect Classification:** Just like humans, an AI's classification is **never 100% perfect**.
    - **Confidence Values:** Well-designed AI systems acknowledge this limitation by providing a **confidence value** along with their response, indicating their certainty.
