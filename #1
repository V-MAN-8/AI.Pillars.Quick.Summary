## **What is the AI :**

- AI Is the development computer systems that can perform tasks typically require human intelligence such as a
    
    thinking , learning , understanding 
    
- and its uses data to enable machines to analyze information recognize patterns and make predictions or take actions to achieve goals

## **What AI does :**

- **Learning:** AI systems learn from large datasets to identify patterns and improve their performance over time, much like humans learn from experience.
- **Problem-solving:** AI can analyze complex data and use logic to find solutions to problems that would typically require human intelligence.
- **Perception:** AI enables machines to "see" and "hear" by processing visual information (like images) and understanding spoken and written language.
- **Decision-making:** Based on the data they process and their learned patterns, AI systems can make informed decisions and take actions to achieve goals.
- **Autonomy:** Some AI systems can operate and adapt their behavior to a degree without constant human intervention.

## **How is AI evolving ? :**

Computer scientists have identified **three levels of AI** based on predicted growth in its ability to analyze data and make predictions. They call these levels:

- Narrow AI
- Broad AI
- General AI

As shown in the following graphic, Narrow AI, and Broad AI are available today. In fact, most enterprises use Broad AI. General AI won’t come online until sometime in the future.

## **Narrow AI :**

- Narrow AI is focused on addressing a single task such as predicting your next purchase or planning your day.
- Narrow AI is scaling very quickly in the consumer world, in which there are a lot of common tasks and data to train AI systems. For example, you can buy a book with a voice-based device.
- Narrow AI also enables robust applications, such as using Siri on an iPhone, the Amazon recommendation engine, autonomous vehicles, and more. Narrow AI systems like Siri have conversational capabilities, but only if you stick to the script.

## **Broad AI**

- Broad AI is a midpoint between Narrow and General AI.
- Rather than being limited to a single task, Broad AI systems are more versatile and can handle a wider range of related tasks.
- Broad AI is focused on integrating AI within a specific business process where companies need business- and enterprise-specific knowledge and data to train this type of system.
- Newer Broad AI systems predict global weather, trace pandemics, and help businesses predict future trends.

## **General AI**

- General AI refers to machines that can perform any intellectual task that a human can.
- Currently, AI does not have the ability to think abstractly, strategize, and use previous experiences to come up with new, creative ideas as humans do, such as inventing a new product or responding to people with appropriate emotions. And don't worry, AI is nowhere near this point.
